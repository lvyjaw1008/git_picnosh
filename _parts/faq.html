	  As a customer, your first choice is deciding whether or not you want to purchase a pre-planned Offerings or request a Seller create a custom Offerings specifically for you. Using a restaurant metaphor - do you want what's on the menu or do you want the chef to make something special just for you?<br/><br/>Once you've decided on a path, you can either search and buy, or wait for our concierge to get back to you in regards to your special request.

	  Your services are presented in two parts - as a inspiration idea, as well as a Offerings plan. <br/><br/>The inspiration idea is the local or offeringist inspiration that is part of, or related to, your Offerings. Your Offerings is your specific plan for capturing a photo set - nearby or including the inspiration. <br/><br/>If a inspiration already exists for your concept, then simply add your Offerings to it. If a inspiration idea doesn't yet exist for your Offerings, create it yourself or contact our concierge to have it created for you. We love capturing the essence of a inspiration, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you wish to list a Offerings for our community. <br/><br/>You can create a inspiration by visiting the inspirations area of your profile. You can add a Offerings plan to any inspiration by by tapping or clicking the 'Apply to join our team' button on the specific inspiration. If you need any help at all, just reach out to the concierge and they will be happy to help you get listed.

This way the customer receives a smaller subset of everything shot, but still a sizeable number of shots to enjoy and share. You provide a few that have been enhanced to the best of your abilities and the customer can themselves further enhance any others from the delivered set.

	  Marketplace is the latest incarnation of The Circumference. We've expanded the site's capabilities, given everything a modern new look, and transitioned from being an editorial business to that of a marketplace. All the amazing inspirations originally found on The Circumference have been moved into Marketplace and featured as inspirations.

	  Injuries during offerings are rare but they do happen. In order to minimize the chance of an accident or injury you should choose offerings that are appropriate for you and your party. If you choose to get your photos taken during a winter ice climb, you should probably be expert ice climbers before the Offerings. If an injury does occur, stop your Offerings immediately and seek medical attention. You are responsible for your own medical coverage and accept the risk of injury when you begin your Offerings.
